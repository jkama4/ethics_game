# Environment Setup

Before setting up, make sure Python 3.13 is installed.

## No Virtual env (pip)
If you don't Poetry to manage dependencies, you can simply use the following command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using Virtual env (recommended)
First, ensure Poetry is installed

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Then, you should go to the directory where you set up the project

```bash
cd ~/path/to/project
```

Now, you can setup the environment

```bash
poetry install
```

And to use it, you call

```bash
$(poetry env activate)
```

Or on Windows

```bash
poetry env activate
```

Alternatively, you can use

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Running The App
To run the app, call

```
cd ~/ethics_game/src/ethics_game
streamlit run
```

Now, your app should be up and running on localhost.
